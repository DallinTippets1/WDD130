Place the font files in this folder so the site can load them via CSS @font-face.

Required files (download and save here):
- Giants.ttf  (Heading/display font)  — https://www.dafont.com/giants-2.font
- Pompadour.ttf (Paragraph font)     — https://www.dafont.com/a-pompadour.font

Save the downloaded .ttf files with the exact filenames above (Giants.ttf, Pompadour.ttf).
After placing the files, refresh your browser to see the fonts applied.

If you prefer to host fonts elsewhere, update `styles/styles.css` @font-face `url()` paths accordingly.
